// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Number prompt,
 enter number,
 "divide number by 2",
 number ends in a "zero = odd"
 everything else is "=even"
 print result
 end)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(A   enter five numbers in prompts,
     output Number1, Number2, number3, Nummber4, Number5,
     
 B   "AVERAGE"= Number1, Number2, number3, Nummber4, Number5 divided by 5
     print average sum
     display in prompt
     end

 C  Maximum
     Number 1 is less than number 2
     maximum = number 2
     number 1 is greater than number 2
     maximum = number 1
     number 3 is greater than maximum
     maximum = number 3
     number 4 is greater than maximum
     maximum = 4
     number 5 is greater than maximum
     
    Minimum
     Number 1 is less than number 2
     minimum = number 1
     number 2 is less than number 1
     minimum = number 2
     number 3 is less than minimum
     minimum = number 3
     number 4 is less than minimum
     minimum = 4
     number 5 is less than minimum
     minimum = 5

 D   Maximum
     output promt box
     Write maximum text for prompt box
     display maximum number

     Minimum
     output promt box
     write minimum text for prompt box
     display minimum number)
